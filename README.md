# Pentest Tool Lookup
Pentest Tool Lookup is a website developed for my college capstone course. Built with the novice penetration tester in mind, this site allows the user to browse and search for a variety of command line tools commonly used for pentesting. Most of these commands can even be modified and copied from the site.

Currently, the site is available here: https://pentoolslookup.gay/

## Status:
While the site is fully functional, there are more tools and examples to add in the future, and possibly support for article formats and GUI tool explainers.

## Tech Used:
This site was made with the following:
* Django Web Framework
* Python
* Vue.js
* JavaScript
* HTML/CSS
* Google Fonts & Material Icons

At the moment, hosting is accomplished via:
* Gunicorn
* Nginx
* Google Cloud Platform
* Namecheap domain name
* Let's Encrypt/Certbot certification
